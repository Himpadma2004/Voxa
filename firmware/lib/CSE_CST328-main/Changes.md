  - Updated the library naming string in Arduino library properties.
  - Removed the `TS_Point` class.
    - This was redundant and was causing conflicts with the `CSE_TouchPoint` class.
    - This also caused the touch issue in the `UI_Test` example.
    - Replaced all `TS_Point` instances with `CSE_TouchPoint`.
    - We will now use the `CSE_TouchPoint` class instead, everywhere.
    - The commented out lines will be removed in the next version.
  - New Version 🆕 `v0.0.4`.

### **+05:30 07:37:25 PM 17-02-2025, Monday**

  - Added `Fast-Read-Touch-Polling` example.
    - This now uses the `fastReadData()` to read a single touch point data.
  - Added `fastReadData()` function.
    - This is faster than `readData()`.
  - Added `isTouched (uint8_t id = 0)` overload.
    - This will only check for the provided touch point for activity.
    - If no parameters are passed, all touch points are checked.
